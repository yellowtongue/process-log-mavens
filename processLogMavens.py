# WHAT THIS DOES
#
# goal of this program is to process Poker Mavens logs to track player activity
# - initial appearance (initial buy-in)
# - addition of chips
# - last known amount of chips
#
# To do this we will take the logs and first break it up into hand by hand, indexed by time
# for a chronology
#
# Then we can loop through each hand, and process for player activity
# the first time we see a player, we add them and their first known chip count
# then in each hand we not additional chips, as well as resolution of the pot
#
# When processing the next hand, everything SHOULD align
# if it does not, throw an error
# otherwise keep processing
#
# look for wins, add ons, and pot contributions
# log cash in and cash out for narrative at end of night
#
# KEY ASSUMPTIONS
#
# assume unique hand number (that is the hand number can NOT repeat across tables)
# assume that the hand number structure NNN-M can be reduced to NNN andt hat the M local part is not needed
# configurable options can be specified in an INI file specified by a constant OPTIONS_FILE below
#
#
# CHANGE LOG
# 2020-04-26 v0.1 first version
# 2020-04-28 v0.2 email results
# 2020-05-12 v0.4 bug fixes
# 2020-05-15 v0.5 added glob work
# 2020-05-15 v0.6 incorporate suggested fixes for numeric formatting and text matching for names
# 2020-06-16 v0.7 move commonly changed options to an INI file loaded at run time
# 2020-06-17 v0.7.1 also support plain text export of emails with names from Mavens
# 2020-06-29 v0.7.2 change  skip prior option behavior to process multiple tables, files in any order
# 2020-12-21 v0.8 initial support for processing tournament result files
# 2021-02-15 v0.8.1 processing tournament result files now allows for multiple results set in same file
# 2021-06-09 v0.8.2 output only specific player information
